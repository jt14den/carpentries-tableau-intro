## Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces learners to Tableau Public using a real-world dataset about traffic collisions in Los Angeles. Learners will move from loading and exploring data, to creating multiple visualizations, and ultimately combining them in an interactive dashboard.

It is suitable for beginners and assumes no prior experience with Tableau.

## Target Audience

- Undergraduate or graduate students
- Library workshop attendees
- Staff or faculty interested in data visualization
- Beginners who are comfortable with basic computer tasks (e.g., installing software, downloading files)

## Software Requirements

Learners should have Tableau Public installed before the session begins. The `setup.md` file includes instructions. Learners must also download the dataset in advance.

## Teaching Tips

- **Start slowly**: Spend time on dimensions vs. measures and discrete vs. continuous. These concepts are key to everything that follows.
- **Use live demos**: Tableau is visual and interactive. Live-clicking through steps will help learners grasp the interface better than screenshots alone.
- **Be transparent**: Tableau's interface changes slightly over time. If yours looks different than theirs, narrate your clicks and explain what you're doing.
- **Encourage exploration**: After each visualization section, ask learners to try changing fields, colors, or filters.
- **Use breakouts**: If teaching online, short breakout sessions for the challenge sections can keep people engaged and collaborative.

## Timing Suggestions

| Episode                        | Time     |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| Introduction                  | 20 mins  |
| Exploring Data                | 25 mins  |
| Creating Visualizations       | 30 mins  |
| Adding Interactivity          | 25 mins  |
| Building Dashboards           | 20 mins  |
| **Total**                     | ~2 hours |

## Troubleshooting

- Tableau may be blocked on some corporate or school laptops. Have a workaround ready (e.g., test ahead or use Tableau Online if needed).
- Slow performance or large datasets can cause Tableau to lag. Use a smaller CSV sample if needed.
- If learners are unfamiliar with drag-and-drop interfaces, model your actions slowly and clearly.
